LLMs open up new frontiers of software. `cograph` is an exploration of collective Bayesian estimation: 
what if we could do quantitative estimation together by overlaying hand-drawn probability distribution functions?
"Hand drawn" is hard so I'm starting with just "can we draw a graph together at all" and we'll bring
in hand-drawing later ☺️

Working examples coming "🔜"™️
